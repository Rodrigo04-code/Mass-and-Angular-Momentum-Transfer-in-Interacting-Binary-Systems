# Mass-and-Angular-Momentum-Transfer-in-Interacting-Binary-Systems
This repository contains the codes, simulations, and analysis developed for my thesis project on the study of mass transfer and angular momentum evolution in interacting binary star systems. It includes theoretical derivations, numerical modeling, and comparisons with previous research.
